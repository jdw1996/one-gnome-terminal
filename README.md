# road-grey-gnome-terminal

**This repository is no longer maintained.  If you are interested in
maintaining it, please let me know.**

This is a port of my
[Road Grey theme](https://github.com/jdw1996/road-grey-syntax) for GNOME
Terminal. It is forked from
[Denys Dovhan's port of Atom's One themes to GNOME Terminal](https://github.com/denysdovhan/one-gnome-terminal).

To install the theme, first execute the following command (note that the
terminal will close after installation):

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdw1996/road-grey-gnome-terminal/master/road-grey.sh && . road-grey.sh
```

Now open a new terminal window and go to **Edit > Preferences > Profiles** to
choose **Road Grey**.

If you have any pointers you'd like to share about my code, find a bug, or want
to suggest an improvement, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/jdw1996/road-grey-gnome-terminal/issues/new)
or email me at [jdwinters96@gmail.com](mailto:jdwinters96@gmail.com).
